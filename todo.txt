Things we will need:

- Function that takes a list, randomly matches and puts out a hash table
- Function to determine if a number is even or odd ( use "if (([Math]::Floor($n/2) * 2) -eq $n) { $true }" or "if ($n % 2 -eq 0) { $true }" )
- Structure for input of names list

Hard parts?:

- Specifying up to 5 people to be "Primary" and not allowing them to match with another "Primary"
- Modifying it so that people can't be matched with the same person twice without going through 4 other matches
-
